## Avoid a Potential Bankruptcy with Bright Credit Debt Relief!
Debt Settlement provides an alternative to bankruptcy

Many consumers and businesses are struggling with unsecured debts such as credit cards, store cards, personal loans, and medical debts. These debts are so burdensome that the consumer or business can no longer pay the minimum balances without sacrificing some basic necessities. In this situation many feel as though bankruptcy is their only solution. Fortunately there is an alternative.

## The truth about debt settlement

First and most importantly Debt settlement is meant only for consumers or businesses who have a legitimate financial hardship. A financial hardship is simply when you have experienced an event such as an injury, loss of job, divorce or medical issue which has made it impossible for you to make your monthly minimum payments without sacrificing your basic needs like, food, rent or transportation.

In these financial hardship situations bankruptcy is most often the course taken. Unfortunately, in bankruptcy unsecured creditors like credit card companies will likely not recover a cent of what is due to them, and you the consumer will ruin your credit worthiness for years. Remember that employers, renters and many services ask if you have EVER filed for bankruptcy, thus although it may not be reported after 10 years, it can have a reach far longer.

## The Alternative to Bankruptcy:

Instead of filing for bankruptcy you can work with us, a team of negotiators who work out a reduction of your debt directly with your creditors or can help you settle your own debts with our DIY coaching program depending on which state that you reside in.
